Wine is a beverage made from fermented grape and other fruit juices with lower amount of alcohol content. 
Quality of wine is graded based on the taste of wine and vintage. This process is time taking, costly and not efficient. 
A wine itself includes different parameters like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free Sulphur dioxide, total Sulphur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol and quality.
 
# Objectives

To predict wine quality using Machine Learning in the Python programming language.
To analyze the quality of wine based on various parameters such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, etc.
To utilize the best possible algorithm to rate the wine on a scale of 1-10 or classify it as bad or good.
To verify the output for accuracy and optimize the model accordingly.
To align with wine expert evaluations and ultimately enhance production.

# Motivation

It can improve decision-making: By predicting the quality of their wines, wineries can make better decisions about production, marketing, and pricing.
It can reduce costs: By optimizing production processes and identifying potential problems early on, wineries can save money.
It can build brand loyalty: By offering consistent, high-quality wines, wineries can build trust and loyalty with their customers.

# Methodology

Data Collection: Obtain wine dataset with attributes and quality ratings.
Data Preprocessing: Analyze, handle missing values, normalize, encode.
Feature Selection: Choose features, engineer if needed.
Model Selection: Pick suitable classification algorithms.
Model Training: Split, validate, train classification models.
Model Evaluation: Assess classification performance, compare models using metrics like accuracy, and etc
Model Deployment: Deploy the trained classification model for making predictions on  wine quality is good or not.
